# Library

Simple WebAPI Project for managing a library.

Uses Repository Pattern to keep DRY, interacts with database using Microsoft Entity Framework Core, uses SQL Server as default DBMS (which can be simply changed
by editing configs to connect to any other DBMS and installing the appropriated Nuget EFCore connector).
